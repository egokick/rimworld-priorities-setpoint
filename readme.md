# RimWorld Set Points Mod

This mod adds a user interface to RimWorld that allows you to define "set points" to control the priorities of each character in the game.

## How it works

You can create set points that are activated when certain conditions are met, such as when the number of cooked meals drops below a specified threshold, and deactivated when another condition is met, like when the number of cooked meals rises above another threshold.

When a set point is activated, it will change the selected priority of a RimWorld character. For example, it could set the cooking priority to 1 (highest priority). When the set point is deactivated, it will revert the priority of the RimWorld character back to a previously selected value, such as setting the cooking priority back to 3 (medium priority).

## Usage

1. Install the mod and start the game.
2. Open the Set Points Mod user interface.
3. Define a set point by specifying:
   - The resource you want to monitor (e.g. cooked meals)
   - The trigger threshold (e.g. 20 cooked meals)
   - The disable threshold (e.g. 40 cooked meals)
   - The selected pawn (i.e. the character you want to control)
   - The selected work type (e.g. cooking)
   - The active priority (e.g. 1)
   - The inactive priority (e.g. 3)
4. Save the set point.
5. The mod will automatically adjust the selected character's priorities based on the defined set points.

Now your characters' priorities will be automatically adjusted to maintain the desired resource levels, helping you to manage your colony more effectively.
